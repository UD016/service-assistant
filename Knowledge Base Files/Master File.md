## Taking a Call

### Objective

Gather all information required to accurately diagnose, quote, schedule, and dispatch a service technician.

### Procedure

1. Greet the customer:

   > "Cummins Service, my name is [your name], how may I help you today?"

2. Have a notebook, paper, or digital document ready to record information.

3. Determine whether an alarm code is present.
   - Record the alarm description.
   - Record the fault code number if available.
   - Examples:
     - Low Coolant
     - FC1223

4. Verify whether the customer already has an account.
   - Existing customer:
     - Retrieve customer number.
     - Confirm name.
     - Confirm billing information.
     - Confirm phone number.
   - New customer:
     - Create a customer account.

5. Obtain site information.
   - Site address
   - On-site contact name
   - On-site contact phone number

6. Obtain generator information.
   - Serial number
   - Data plate information
   - Safety concerns

7. For ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch) issues:
   - Confirm whether a simulated power outage can be performed.
   - Confirm a suitable testing time.

8. For non-Cummins generators:
   - Advise the customer that a technician can still be dispatched.
   - Explain that the technician may not be certified on that specific equipment.
   - Inform the customer that they may be referred to a specialized provider if necessary.

# Cash Customers

## Policy Overview

Cash customers create higher financial risk because no approved credit account exists.

### Key Principles

#### No Guaranteed Payment

Service work without payment protection exposes the branch to financial risk.

#### Pre-Authorization Is Not Payment

A pre-authorization:

- Does not guarantee collection
- Must be converted to final payment

#### Cash Flow Protection

Prompt collection protects:

- Cash flow
- Financial stability
- Operational efficiency

### Coordinator Expectations

- Track outstanding balances daily
- Follow up immediately
- Convert pre-authorizations quickly
- Close completed jobs promptly
